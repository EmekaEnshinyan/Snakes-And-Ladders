# Imports
from random import choice, choices, randint

# Parameters
num_snakes = 5
num_ladders = 5

# Setting min and max positions for snake heads and tails, and ladder bases and tops.
min_snake_head = 2 # The shortest and lowest snake could possibly be from 2 to 1.
max_snake_head = 100 # Not inclusive. Last square is where a player wins.

min_snake_tail = 1 # Inclusive.

max_ladder_base = 100 # Exclusive. Can't have a ladder base on the last square.
min_ladder_base = 2 # Inclusive. We decided to keep the first square clean of ladders.

max_ladder_top = max_ladder_base + 1 # Exclusive. 
min_ladder_top = min_ladder_base + 1 # Inclusive. 


# Procedure

# Player 1 Name
p1_name = "Red"

# Player 1 Position
p1_position = 0

# Player 2 Name
p2_name = "Blue"

# Player 2 Position
p2_position = 0

# Snake Head Positions

sections of below line
aim - one line of code was to avoid repetitions
choices - returns a list of integers where the number of el is based on the value of k
choices(range where n1 inclusive is less than n2 exclusive, k=<>)
range - (n1, n2 where n2 > n1)

my_range = range(min_snake_head, max_snake_head)
my_k = num_snakes
snake_heads = choices(my_range, k=my_k)


'''
snake_heads = choices(range(min_snake_head, max_snake_head), k=num_snakes)


# Snake Tail Positions
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 1. Now you have 5 snake heads locations
# 2. That means that the available location for tails is a list of 1 to 99, 
#    excluding snake_heads
# 3. We create a new list using a similar method to step 2.
# 4. Iterate 5 times, where each element has to be lower than its 
#    corresponding element in snake_heads.
# 5. Update the list of "non-available squars" so each snake will have its own
#    unique square for a tail.

'''
work from inside out
1. convert range to list
    ex: list(range(5)) = list(range(0,5))
    returns [0,1,2,3,4]

'''

'''
choice() - returns val 
choices() - returns list
NOTE: choice() and choices() can take a range of ints or a list
TODO: abc 
    but beware that both methods, if taking in a list, can return repeated el in new list
we are using set() because the choices the el of ist_1 does not gurantee that el list_2 will be unique from choices()
